                    <p class="lead">609 - What our research is showing is that the heart is 100 times stronger electrically than the
                      brain and the heart is 5000 times stronger than the brain magnetically. Does that mean magnetism
                      is a stronger force than electricity and that is why your means of space travel and energy production
                      are based on Magnetism rather than electricity?</p>

                    <p>Thomas, you are referring to a symptom of magnetism. Electricity is nothing more than a practical
                      use of basic magnetism. Electricity does not exist without magnetism. Even in the processes of
                      chemical or frictional generation of electricity, is the "magnetism of the intermolecular interaction"
                      that generates electricity at the end. You will learn from your development, the magnetic energy
                      has several quantum forms. The magnetism generated with your minerals can attract other minerals,
                      but there are ways to unipolar magnetic energy that can act on any subject, a simple example is
                      your "gravity", which acts as a magnet attracting any kind of matter. Another example is the levitation
                      of objects, which is "a voluntary issue," a kind of directed unipolar magnetic energy, which is
                      opposed to a static magnetic force acting on any matter. These bundles of magnetic energy can carry
                      the quantum energy of the aura of a healthy person to a mental or physical healing of sick people,
                      expression "miracle" is attributable to these demonstrations, and are little understood by you
                      yet. Just to explain to those unaware, a unipolar magnetic field is like a magnet with only one
                      pole, north without south or south without the north, is a bundle of magnetic energy that can dynamically
                      change the polarity, making the magnetic energy usable in any condition or situation required.

                      be good to have more details for this, so... if i understand this, an individual knowing this,
                      could implement healing to others?? i love the idea that we could learn this, to heal. thank you
                      in advance, blessings.</blockquote>
